# HellBirdie
Hell birdie is lost in our world and needs your help to get back to his dark home.  Hell Birdie is definitely challenging. Its a bit similar to flappy bird but with some interested tweaks. You tap to bounce, but taps on the left of the screen bounce you left and taps on the right bounce you right. Rather than flying side to side, youâ€™re trying to slowly advance up through obstacles. The combination or upward movement and limited movement controls, makes it an easy to game to pick up but difficult to master
